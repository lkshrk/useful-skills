# Portable saved-variable importer

Use [scripts/import_saved_variables.py](../scripts/import_saved_variables.py) for supplied `WoWthing_Collector.lua` and `AllTheThings.lua` exports. Python 3.9+ and its standard library are sufficient. It does not connect to a game host, use network credentials, execute Lua, modify source saves, or edit Markdown task status.

## Run

```sh
python3 /path/to/wow-account-setup/scripts/import_saved_variables.py \
  --collector /path/to/WoWthing_Collector.lua \
  --att /path/to/AllTheThings.lua \
  --account main \
  --region eu \
  --output /path/to/account-observations.json \
  --report /path/to/account-coverage.md
```

Use a stable user-chosen account alias and the actual region. Import another account into a different output. Source filenames/paths are provided by the user/environment, not discovered through machine-specific connection setup.

The same command can refresh an existing output. Only a compatible `wow-account-observations` snapshot for the same account/region is accepted. Existing character records absent from the new export are retained and marked not seen in this import; absence does not mean deletion. Missing fields keep prior observations and dates. Repeated identical data does not duplicate characters or reset user progress.

Outputs must differ from inputs and each other. The JSON is replaced atomically after parsing/validation; input or format errors leave the previous snapshot intact. Existing non-generated Markdown is never overwritten. Snapshot/report writes are individually atomic, not a multi-file transaction; if report writing fails after the JSON succeeds, the CLI explicitly reports that the snapshot was saved. Do not run concurrent importers against one output; the script detects output changes during processing but is not a multi-writer database.

## What is normalized

| Observation | Handling |
| --- | --- |
| Character identity | Exact Collector GUID → direct `ATTCharacterData` GUID/name/realm; nested boss names, item-link GUIDs and unrelated addon tables do not participate |
| Reputation | Recorded faction IDs and Collector values, separated into character and account scopes; values still need faction definitions for standing, renown or friendship interpretation |
| Currency | Decodes the seven-field Collector format; preserves observed zero, omits its no-currency sentinel, and treats absent IDs as unknown |
| Profession | Partial skill-line entries, skill values and known **skill-line ability IDs**, not a complete recipe/spell roster or automatic eligibility proof |
| Achievement | Selected **character-earned** flags and available criterion quantities; not account-wide completion, complete catalog coverage or account AP |
| Inventory | Recorded containers/slots with item IDs, quantities and original item encoding; bag and bank scan times remain separate; missing containers/items do not establish absence everywhere |
| Shared bank | Recorded shared containers under account scope, with their scan timestamp |
| Character basics | Observed level, copper, current location and bind location; missing scalar fields do not clear prior values |

Account AP remains null. Do not sum Collector character achievements or promote a character-incomplete flag into an account-incomplete fact. Obtain account completion/AP from a validated account source and reconcile it in the planning layer.

The parser supports saved-variable literal assignments, tables, string/integer keys, quoted UTF-8 strings (including decimal byte escapes), numbers, booleans, nil and line comments. Calls, functions, expressions, duplicate keys, malformed data, excessive nesting and files over 64 MiB fail closed. It is not a general Lua interpreter. Unknown field encodings are marked unsupported and retained as raw field data; they are never guessed into valid quantities.

## Output contract and freshness

The JSON has `kind: wow-account-observations`, `schema_version: 1`, account/region, import time, source filename/hashes, Collector format version, `characters`, `account_observations`, `coverage` and limitations. Each GUID record has:

- Identity status (`matched`, `unmatched`, `conflicting`), direct identity evidence, and whether identity was present in this import or retained.
- Last-seen time and `present_in_latest_import`; an ATT-only historical character is not added to the current Collector roster.
- Per-field `observations`: scope, partial/unsupported/conflicting status, normalized values, source hash, exact scan clocks, notes and whether the field was present in this import.

`partial` describes source coverage, not necessarily uncertainty in each present value. A recorded quantity can be useful while absent IDs remain unknown. Undated professions are not assigned the character's last-seen time as a fabricated profession scan time. Mixed inventory retains its component clocks rather than displaying a falsely fresh single timestamp.

Newer dated observations replace older ones. Differing values with older, equal, absent or incomparable clocks retain the last observation and place the incoming candidate in a conflict record. Missing fields retain the prior value/date. Same data and clocks do not create a conflict. Inventory refreshes require non-regressing bag/bank clocks; inspect conflicts rather than assuming every container has the newest timestamp. A newer valid observation can resolve an earlier field conflict.

Keep user-owned notes, manual completion, deferrals and feedback under a root or per-character `user` object. These survive refreshes; importer-owned identity/observations/coverage metadata may change. User task notes are never touched. Do not use the output JSON as a second editable checkbox store.

## Handoff to planning and views

This is the **observation dataset**, not `wow-achievement-dashboard`'s view JSON. The importer does not invent task names, base AP, categories, routes, prices, eligibility, timings or research. Feed these scoped observations into the planner; then populate the dashboard's separate schema and canonical task notes with researched decisions. A blank dashboard field is preferable to manufactured facts.

Onboarding uses the Markdown report to identify exact gaps. Resolve identity conflicts before naming an eligible executor; request a missing in-game scan only when data is genuinely absent, not merely hidden on a public website. Preserve dates and scope through every downstream transformation.

## Verify

```sh
python3 /path/to/wow-account-setup/scripts/check_import.py
```

The check uses synthetic fixtures and temporary outputs. It covers safe parsing, exact identity joins, scope separation, real zeros, partial coverage, clock conflicts, repeated/partial imports, preserved user metadata and CLI failure safety. It never reads the originating user's account or environment. Inspect actual source format/coverage when importing a different addon version; passing fixture tests is not evidence of a complete account scan.
