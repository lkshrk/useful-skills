# World of Warcraft skills

A set of skills that turn your AI assistant (ChatGPT, Claude or Codex) into a World of
Warcraft helper. Ask in plain language — no commands or coding needed.

## What you can ask

| Skill | What it does | Try asking |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `wow-help` | Quick answers about items, quests, vendors, reputation and game mechanics, with map waypoints. | "Where do I get this mount?" |
| `wow-spec` | Talent builds (with copyable import strings), stats, gems, enchants and consumables. | "Best Frost Mage build for Mythic+?" |
| `wow-account-setup` | One-time setup: connects your existing character data so plans fit *your* account. | "Set up my WoW account for achievement planning." |
| `wow-achievement-plan` | A personal achievement or progression checklist: quests, reputation, professions and items, with realistic times and eligible characters. | "Plan my TBC Anniversary reputation grind." |
| `wow-achievement-dashboard` | An overview of your plan: next actions, progress and routes, with static checklists for non-achievement goals. | "Make a dashboard for my achievement plan." |
| `wow-duo-world-tour` | A shared achievement or progression route for you and a friend, showing who gets credit for what. | "Plan a 2-hour quest and profession tour for us." |

## Install

Download [wow-skills.zip](https://github.com/lkshrk/useful-skills/releases/latest/download/wow-skills.zip)
and double-click it. You get a folder with one file per skill. Don't unzip those.

### ChatGPT

   Repeat for each skill you want.

```

## Getting started

1. For quick questions and builds (`wow-help`, `wow-spec`), just ask — no setup.
2. For personal achievement plans, start with *"set up my WoW account"*. The
   assistant uses data you already have — e.g. a WoWthing or Simple Armory
   profile (sites that track your characters), or addon data saved in your
   WoW folder — and only asks for the missing pieces.

## Good to know

- **Game versions:** use Retail, a specific Classic variant, or Forever. If the
  version isn't clear, the assistant asks and remembers it for that character or
  plan. It uses the matching sections of existing sources such as Wowhead,
  Method, Raider.IO and Warcraft Logs, and explains any coverage gap.
- **Current tool coverage:** the bundled player-state importer and automated
  build/season-refresh helpers remain Retail-specific. The achievement views
  support Retail and MoP Classic live data. Other contexts and progression goals
  use ordinary Markdown plans; addon/API compatibility is checked before import.
- **Output:** plans are saved as simple checklist files you can open anywhere.
  If you use [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md) (a notes app), they can go there instead.
- **Waypoints:** routes come as commands for the [TomTom](https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/tomtom)
  map-arrow addon — copy, paste into game chat, follow the arrow.
- **In ChatGPT or the Claude app:** the assistant can't look into your computer,
  so drag any file it asks for (e.g. from your WoW folder) into the chat, and
  download the plans it creates.
- **Sources:** answers link to Wowhead and similar sites so you can double-check.
- **Privacy:** your passwords and login details are never stored, and no addons
  are installed without you.
